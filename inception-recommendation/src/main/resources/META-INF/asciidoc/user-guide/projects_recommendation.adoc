== Recommenders
Recommenders provide annotation support by predicting potential labels.
These can be either accepted or rejected by the user.
The recommenders learn from this interaction to further improve the quality of predictions.

After clicking on *Recommenders*, you are displayed a new pane in which you can add new recommenders
by clicking on the button *Create*. You have to select the layer, feature and the classification tool.
The recommenders are trained every time you create, update or delete an annotation;
and evaluated every second time. During recommender evaluation the f-score of each recommender is calcultated,
and recommenders with a lower f-score than their threshold will not be selected for the next training step.
By making a tick on the checkbox next to *Always active* or leaving the threshold at 0,
you can choose to skip f-score evaluation to ensure that the recommender runs at all times.
